# Harvest

The current repository contains the first basic version of Liquidswap Harvest (Staking) contracts.
The main purpose of contracts is to allow the staking of LP coins and earn community/3rd party project reward coins.

Supported features:

* The contracts are permissionless and can be used for any Stake/Reward coins pair.
* Each staking pool has a reward rate per second set by the pool creator.
* Rewards can be deposited to a pool at any time.
* User can unstake own coins without loss of profit at any time after one week since the stake passed.
* User can withdraw rewards at any time.
* Pool can be emergency stopped, and stakers can withdraw their stake.
* **Important:** as it's permissionless, we will allowlist only trusted pools on our end (UI).
